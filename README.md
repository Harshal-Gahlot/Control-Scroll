# Chrome Extension

Generally speaking, shorts waste our time by by emphasizing trivial content that doesn't contribute to our personal growth or knowledge.

But there are times when shorts actually help us by providing quality information quickly. However, it's very easy to fall into the trap of mindlessly scrolling through shorts.

This extension allows users to watch only a limited number of shorts per session (by default, 3).
A new session starts when the page is reloaded.

This helps users stay on track and gives them a moment to rethink their viewing habits.

## Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Chrome browser and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable the "Developer mode" toggle.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the cloned repository folder.
5. The extension should now be installed and ready to use.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, you can test/use it by following these steps:

1. Open www.youtube.com/shorts/ in the Chrome browser.
2. Watch 3 shorts or wait for 3 min. (you can quickly skip shorts)
3. You can't watch shorts anymore and some text is displayed.
